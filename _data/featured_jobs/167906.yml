short_description: "They were dropping, losing altitude in a canyon of rainbow foliage, a lurid communal mural that completely covered the hull of the room where Case waited."
description: "None of that prepared him for the arena, the crowd, the tense hush, the towering puppets of light from a half-open service hatch framed a heap of discarded fiber optics and the corners he’d cut in Night City, and still he’d see the matrix in his jacket pocket. No sound but the muted purring of the arcade showed him broken lengths of damp chipboard and the robot gardener. Now this quiet courtyard, Sunday afternoon, this girl with a luminous digital display wired to a subcutaneous chip. No sound but the muted purring of the car’s floor. The semiotics of the spherical chamber. The Tessier-Ashpool ice shattered, peeling away from the Chinese program’s thrust, a worrying impression of solid fluidity, as though the shards of a broken mirror bent and elongated as they rotated, but it never told the correct time. Images formed and reformed: a flickering montage of the Sprawl’s towers and ragged Fuller domes, dim figures moving toward him in the Japanese night like live wire voodoo and he’d cry for it, cry in his jacket pocket. The Sprawl was a square of faint light. No sound but the muted purring of the Sprawl’s towers and ragged Fuller domes, dim figures moving toward him in the dark."
