<p class="call-out">'Responsive web design' was a theoretical concept coupled with a bit of practical code in 2010 when Ethan Marcotte first coined the term in his article for <cite>A List Apart</cite>. In five years, the responsive design approach has grown into a universally-accepted standard for designing interactive experiences on the web. Along the way, process, tools, and technology have changed rapidly, making the approach to successful web design a constantly moving target and leaving web teams with questions about how to adapt.</p>

<p>When Karen and Ethan joined forces in 2014, they began educating web designers worldwide with an email newsletter, in-house workshops, and a podcast documenting interviews with over 100 organizations large and small.</p>
