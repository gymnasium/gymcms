<p>
We’re excited to have Brad Frost of <cite>Atomic Design</cite> and Sophie Shepherd of GitHub join our Academic Director Jeremy as he leads a conversation about creativity, design systems, and their paradoxical relationship.
</p>
<p>
Prepare to cover a lot of ground—from usability and efficiency to flexibility and innovation.
</p>
<p>
This webinar is for anyone wondering what design systems are, how to use them, and if they can really boost creativity. (Hint: yep!)
</p>
<p class="call-out">
Enjoy the show.
