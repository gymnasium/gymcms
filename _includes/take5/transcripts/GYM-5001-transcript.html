<p>Hi there and welcome to Aquent Gymnasium’s Take 5 Series, where we show you in five minutes or less — a tip, trick, or technique that we think you’ll find useful. Today’s Take 5 is “How to Create a CSS Knockout Effect”.</p>

    <p>My name’s Jeremy Osborn and I’m the academic director of Gymnasium.</p>

    <p>So this is the effect you’ll be learning how to do and its known a “knockout” effect because it’s using the outline or shape of your text to knock out or mask an image giving it the effect of appearing within the characters.</p>

    <p>I’m going to be working on a <a href="https://codepen.io/josborn/pen/vMyyxg">CodePen project</a> and you can <a href="https://codepen.io/josborn/pen/vMyyxg">join me by visiting this URL</a>. To save time, I’ve already created a heading in HTML, and in the CSS there are a few simple rules which you should look over: so we have the <code>font-family</code>, <code>font-size</code>, a <code>background-image</code> which is 800 by 200 pixels, and note that the image is set to no-repeat, if that wasn’t there, the image would be tiling or repeating by default. Finally we have our text color set to darkblue.</p>

    <p>About that darkblue color: I want to point out that this effect I’m about to show you would work without this color, but we need it it here as a fallback for browsers that don’t support this effect. So for your own projects just make sure to choose a color that works well with the color scheme of your design.</p>

    <p>In the HTML you should add a css class named “clip” to your heading and now create a CSS class called <code>.clip</code> and now add the property <code>-webkit-background-clip</code> with the value of “text”. So now you will see a change in the image as the background image disappears, so this means the text is indeed clipping, but we’re not finished. Notice that the darkblue color is still visible, not the image, so the next step is make that color transparent and this can be accomplished with this style rule: <code>-webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;</code></p>

    <p>That’s the final effect, pretty cool right? The advantage we have now over an image editor is that it’s trivial to update the content like so: I’ll change the content here from the “The Web” to “The Cloud” like so.</p>

    <p>So that’s it, we could stop here, but we’re not going to do that, we’re going to go a little further and what if we wanted to use something different than a background image, sucha as a background gradient? Luckily, I happen to have one here in my clipboard and I’m going to add a linear gradient and you can see it goes from light blue to dark blue back to light blue. If you ever want to see what this looks like without the clipping effect you can remove the clip class like so and you can see the original non-clipped version. So that’s pretty useful.</p>

    <p>But what else could we do in there? Let’s try an SVG background image. That’s novel! Again, I happen to have something handy in my clipboard and I’m going to add this big mess of code here and this an SVG background image. We don’t really have enough time to talk about what that is, it’s just a cool thing you can use as a web graphic.</p>

    <p>Let’s go ahead and again see what this looks like without being clipped, so we’re going to remove the clip class and you can see it’s a just a big graphic with a pattern and if we wanted it to repeat, remember how we talked about that, we could choose background-repeat:repeat and this gives us a tiling background image. But let’s put that clip back and there’s our final effect.</p>

    <p>So at this point it’s possible that some of you might be thinking “How could I take this further?” could you, for example, add a text shadow to this? That’s actually a really terrible idea, for multiple reasons.</p>

    <p>So we should do it.</p>

    <p>Let’s just see what happens. So in our clip class if we add <code>text-shadow</code> and give it some values here: 8 pixel, 8 pixel, 2 pixel and the color blue, that looks, ok? I don’t actually it looks a little weird and you could probably do this without the clipping mask at all, but what if we played around with the opacity values. Let’s change that last value from <code>1</code> to <code>0.2</code>. That’s kind of cool. Maybe that’s something? I don’t know, I don’t recommend you do it, this is probably a really bad idea. (But if you do do it, let me know, I want to see it.)</p>

    <p>That’s it for now, thanks for watching I hope you found it useful.
