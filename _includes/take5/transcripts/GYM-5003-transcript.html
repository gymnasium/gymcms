<p>In this tutorial you’re going to add a gradient overlay to an image that starts like this… and ends like this using only CSS. In the past you could only do this sort of effect in an image editor such as Photoshop, but the ability to do this in CSS is faster, easier to update and more suited for responsive layouts such as this one seen here.</p>

<p>This is the project on Codepen you’ll be working with and here is the URL which you can also find linked within the Resources section for this video.</p>

<p>Currently, the text is styled white and not very readable, so you’re going to add a gradient to darken the background but allow the image to remain visible. In the HTML, you have a div with the class of “container” and then there is a nested div named content. </p>

<p>To add the gradient, you’re going to use the container style which is using the background image of the palm trees which is centered and covered with these two styles here. You’ll notice there is a duplicate background-image property and value here. This is not a mistake, I put this line in to save some time. The code you’re about to write will be for modern browsers that support css gradients, this first background-image style will serve as a fallback for older browsers that don’t support gradients, but at least they will get an image.</p>

<p>Place your cursor before the word ‘url’ and press return twice. Now, in the empty line above type</p>

<pre>
	<code>
linear-gradient( hsla(300, 50%, 50%, 1),black),
	</code>
	</pre>


<p>Be sure to add that comma and let’s break this syntax down: A simple gradient needs a minimum of two color stops: a start color and an end color, a gradient is simply the transition the browser draws between the two. So here, the first color stop is pink as defined by an HSLA color, which I’ll explain in a second, then there’s a comma and then the second color stop is defined by the color keyword” black”. </p>

<p>The image is hidden because the gradient is not transparent which you’ll fix in a second, but let’s talk about how HSLA colors work, H stands for Hue and the values go from 0 to 360 around a color wheel. So your value of 300 would be somewhere around here-ish.</p>

<p>S stands for saturation and the values range from 0 to 100%. Zero percent will be some shade of gray and 100% will be an intensely colorful version of your hue. you used 50% which would put us right in the middle.</p>

<p>L stands for lightness and the values range from 0 to 100% where 0% is black, 100% is the white color for your hue and 50% of lightness corresponds to the normal state of the color. Again that’s the value you used.</p>

<p>Alpha is transparency and the values range from 1 which is fully opaque to 0 which is completely transparent. A value of 0.5 means 50% transparent so we now see the pattern background behind our circle. </p>

<p>Before you experiment with transparency, let’s add a color hint which is another word for “midpoint” and to see this: type 10% after the first color, and then type a comma to separate this value from the second color.</p>

<pre>
	<code>
background-image:linear-gradient(hsla(300,50%,50%,1),10%,black)
	</code>
	</pre>


<p>This sets the midpoint 10% of the way from the top so we get a tiny sliver of pink and then the rest is black gradient. Go ahead and change this to 50% which is the default value you started with, even though it wasn’t made explicit. You’ll be returning to the midpoint in just a moment, but now you’ll explore transparency</p>

<p>Change the last value to 0, the top half is fully transparent and then gradually becomes more opaque. </p>
<pre>
	<code>
 background-image:linear-gradient(hsla(300,50%,50%,0),50%,black)
	</code>
	</pre>

<p>Notice there’s no pink left? That’s because the full transparency is overriding it. To bring some color back, type 0.5 for alpha.</p>
<pre>
	<code>
linear-gradient(hsla(300,50%,50%,0.5),50%,black)
	</code>
	</pre>

<p>You can get more colorful by changing the second color stop from black to “coral”.</p>
<p>Remember the color hint from earlier? Change the 50% value to 90% to push the midpoint almost to the bottom, </p>

<pre>
	<code>
linear-gradient(hsla(300,50%,50%,0.5),90%,coral)
	</code>
	</pre>

<p>The colors are looking good, but readability is getting lost, so change the lightness value to 20%, the saturation value to 80% and reduce the transparency of everything to 0.7. I like this result, but your personal tastes may vary so feel free to play around.</p>

<p>If you want more control over the bottom color, you could always use another hsla color or any other value you like: if you prefer RGB, use that, or a hexadecimal color would work. Personally I do like HSLA and there’s a great tool I rely on called http://hslpicker.com which allows you to choose a color by eye, get an hsla value,  and then copy and paste that into your css. Now you have the same sort of control and could change any of the values as needed. </p>
