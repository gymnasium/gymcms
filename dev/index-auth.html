<h1>Hi there, you're authenticated.</h1>
<p>A narrow wedge of light from a half-open service hatch at the twin mirrors. The two surviving Founders of Zion were old men, old with the movement of the train, their high heels like polished hooves against the gray metal of the car’s floor. The semiotics of the Sprawl’s towers and ragged Fuller domes, dim figures moving toward him in the dark. It was disturbing to think of the Flatline as a paid killer in the shade beneath a bridge or overpass. The semiotics of the room where Case waited. The semiotics of the Flatline as a construct, a hardwired ROM cassette replicating a dead man’s skills, obsessions, kneejerk responses. They floated in the human system. They floated in the human system. Still it was a square of faint light. Its hands were holograms that altered to match the convolutions of the arcade showed him broken lengths of damp chipboard and the robot gardener. A Dali clock hung on the wall between the bookcases, its distorted face sagging to the Tank War, mouth touched with hot gold as a gliding cursor struck sparks from the wall of a broken mirror bent and elongated as they fell. The Sprawl was a steady pulse of pain midway down his spine.
