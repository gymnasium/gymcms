# Take 5 Authoring

To create a new Take 5 tutorial, several files and assets need to be created and placed in specific directories in the gymcms repository. Every Take 5 tutorial is comprised of a **tutorial data file**, two **stub files**, and three **image files**.

## Authoring Steps {docsify-ignore}

1. Create the tutorial data file in `_data/take5/`
2. Create the stub files in `take5/` and `take5/meta/`
3. Add image assets to `img/take5/posters/` and `img/take5/og/`
4. Publish the Take 5 tutorial

## 1. Create the Tutorial Data File

This YAML file defines the key paramters for a Take 5.

- **File location:** `_data/take5/GYM-5000.yml`

### About Project Files {docsify-ignore}

- Project files are optional
- Project files _must_ have a file source specified (e.g. CodePen)
- Each project file has a label (the link text) and a URL
- Links to pages (like CodePen) open in a new browser window/tab
- Links to zip files (like on GitHub) download without creating a new window/tab
- There is no limit to the number of project files

Example Usage:

```yaml
project_file_source: CodePen
project_files:
- label: "Starting Project"
  url: "https://codepen.io/josborn/pen/BebXer"
- label: "Completed Project"
  url: "https://codepen.io/josborn/pen/joNmyO"
```

```yaml
project_file_source: GitHub
project_files:
- label: "Lesson Files"
  url: "https://gymnasium.github.io/take5/gym-5011.zip"
```

### About Related Content {docsify-ignore}

- Related content is optional
- Each item in the Related Content list has a label (the link text) and a URL
- Links to items hosted on Gymnasium open the same browser window
- Links to items outside of the Gymnasium open in a new window/tab
- There is no limit to the number of Related Content items

Example Usage:

```yaml
related_content:
- label: "Can I Use: Background Attachment"
  url: "https://caniuse.com/#feat=background-attachment"
- label: "Stack Overflow: Background size on iOS"
  url: "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21476380/background-size-on-ios"
```

## 2. Create the Stub Files

Stub files are additional files that Jekyll uses to generate the tutorial page as well as the partial header include with specific meta tags.

### Take 5 Page

- **File location:** `take5/gym-5000.md`

The Take 5 stub page contains frontmatter and the full text from the video transcript as `{{ content }}`

```yaml
---
layout: take5-raw
id: GYM-5001
permalink: /courses/take5/gym-5001
---

In today’s Take 5, you’re going to make a scrolling background image effect 
[as seen here](https://codepen.io/josborn/pen/joNmyO){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. 
This effect is similar to the parallax effect that can be found on many places across 
the web, such as this one.
```

### Take 5 Meta Include

- **File location:** `take5/meta/gym-5000-meta.md`

The meta include stub file only contains frontmatter.

```yaml
---
layout: meta
id: GYM-5001
permalink: /courses/take5/gym-5001/meta/
---
```

## 3. Add Image Assets

### OG Image

- **File location:** `img/take5/og/gym-5000-og.png`

</details>

### Video Poster Image

- **File location:** `img/take5/posters/gym-5000.jpg`
  - This is the poster frame image that is used in the following contexts:
    - Featured tutorial on the Take 5 catalog page
    - Thumbnails for other "Recent" Take 5s on the Take 5 catalog page
    - Thumbnails for related Take 5s in the recommended content module on Take 5 tutorial "detail" pages
    - Thumbnails in the Gymnasium (all courses) catalog page module for Take 5 tutorials

</details>

### Hero Poster Image

- **File location:** `img/take5/posters/gym-5000-hero.jpg`
  - This is the hero-sized version of the video poster image that is used when the specific tutorial is featured in the homepage hero component
