    <h2>How Can I Tell If A Course Is Right For Me?</h2>
    <p>All Gymnasium courses are designed to help you succeed. The <a href="/courses">course catalog</a> is the best place to start: it’s chock full of information, including the entire video for the first lesson of each course. If you’re still unsure, just enroll <i>(remember: it’s <strong>free</strong>)</i> and take the optional Assessment Quiz in the Get Started section. Scoring 70% or better means the course is probably right for you. Even if you score lower than that you can still take the course, though you might have to work harder to succeed.</p>
