    <h2>How Much Do Courses Cost?</h2>
    <p>Every class is free. That’s right — no hidden fees. No ‘freemium’ upgrade offers. All of our classes are absolutely free of charge. Sign up. Sign in. Learn and succeed. For free.</p>

  <li>
    <h2>Do I Need To Buy Any Books?</h2>

    <h2>What’s A Gym Short?</h2>
    <p>Gym Shorts are, for lack of a better word, merely shorter versions of full Gymnasium courses. Shorts are an hour or less of video instruction and involve no exams, quizzes, or assignments. Because there’s no final exam, you won’t get a certificate for completion. You will, though, have the satisfaction that you learned something amazing and useful during your lunch hour.</p>

    <h2>How Can I Tell If A Course Is Right For Me?</h2>
    <p>All Gymnasium courses are designed to help you succeed. The <a href="/courses">course catalog</a> is the best place to start: it’s chock full of information, including the entire video for the first lesson of each course. If you’re still unsure, just enroll <i>(remember: it’s <strong>free</strong>)</i> and take the optional Assessment Quiz in the Get Started section. Scoring 70% or better means the course is probably right for you. Even if you score lower than that you can still take the course, though you might have to work harder to succeed.</p>
