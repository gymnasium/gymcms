      <h2>YOU'RE CLOSE!</h2>
      <p>We're thrilled you’ve made it this far. You’ve scored a <span class="exam-score-container"></span> on the exam. To pass you need to get greater than an 80.</p>

      <p>Lucky for you, you've still got one more chance to pass. This would be a great time to go back and review the course material. Take a look at things you may have struggled with and have another go when you feel prepared. </p>

      <p>Good luck!</p>
