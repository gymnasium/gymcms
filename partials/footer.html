{%-comment-%}
In favor of DRY-ness, we're including the component below in multiple places...
TODO: move to /partials/footer.html for consistency
{%-endcomment-%}
{%- include partials/footer.html -%}
{%-comment-%}
This component is intended to inject javascript and/or tracking pixels to the bottom of the Gymnasium theme (just before the closing body tag)
{%-endcomment-%}
{%- include partials/theme-bottom.html -%}
