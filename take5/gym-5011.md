In this tutorial you’re going to learn how to use Smart Layout, to follow along, you can download the Sketch lesson file at this URL although there is also a link to the file in the resources section for this video.

Smart Layout allows you to control the appearance and behavior of any symbol you create in Sketch by applying either horizontal or vertical layout to it. You’ll look at horizontal layout first. Each pair of these buttons has a specific layout that I’ve applied to it. 

You’re going to do some typing to force each one to adapt to the content, and when you’re done, I’ll show you how it works. Click on the first button and in the Override field, type “Cd”, click the second button type “Streaming Audio” you get overflowing text.

This two buttons are based on the No Layout model, which is the default mode for symbol instances. Now you’ll explore how Smart Layout changes the entire game.

Click on this button and type “CD” in the Override field and the button width shrinks, click on the second button, type “Streaming Audio” and the button width expands, this is very convenient! Equally important is how  the layout changed. In both cases, the left edge remained fixed and on this button, the right edge contracted and on this one it expanded from left to right. 

Type the word CD in this next button, and the layout shrinks, but this time from the center and with equal amounts of space on both sides. Type “Streaming Audio” and again, equal amounts of space are added to both sides. This is the behavior of horizontal centered layout.

Add the same content for these two buttons and again, the buttons adapt, but this time the right edge of the button stays fixed and in the case of the long text, the button layout expands to the left.

Click on the Symbols page and click on each of these Master Symbols and sure enough, this first one uses No Lout, the second uses Left to Right layout, the third is Horizontal Centered and the last uses Right to Left.

While we’re here, click on this green master symbol and change the layout from none to Horizontal Centered and let’s see what happens. 

However, back on our main page, our layout has not changed, the reason is because of the way  Sketch interprets overrides on a symbol instance. Hover over this double-arrow icon which reads  “Shrink Instance to Fit Content”, click once and indeed, the button shrinks. Do the same thing here and the button expands. The Best Practice here is if you ever change the layout type of a symbol, be sure to click the fit content button to adjust your instance.

You can also define Smart Layout, whenever you create a symbol. Here’s a quick example.

Press R and then click and drag a rectangle, Press T and type the word label and drag it to the center. Now click and drag over the whole thing and press Create Symbol. The drop-down menu is set to No Layout, but if you click on that you’ll see some familiar options, choose Horizontal, click OK, then type Streaming Audio in your override field and there you go, working as expected.

To explore vertical layout click on this page and when you add text into this description field, it overflows by default, which is no good, so undo and double-click anywhere to get into the symbol.

Change the vertical layout from No Layout to Vertical, and specifically this first option Top to Bottom, because when you add text you want the top of my container to stay fixed and the layout to push everything downwards like so, it does and I’m happy, this is cool.

Double-click on this again to look at the symbol, because I want to give you a little warning, this card component is more complicated than our buttons, and I did a few things here that we don’t have time to explore, for example this group of the album, artist and description are pinned to the top, left and right edges and have a fixed size as well. As are a few of the other objects such as the image.

Understanding those fundamentals of Sketch are critical to mastering Smart Layout, which allows you to do cool things like resize your components both horizontally and vertically, just remember the best practice I mentioned earlier, and if your instances aren’t acting the way you would expect, look for the fit content icon and click it to adjust your layout.

That’s it for now, thanks for watching. I hope you found it useful. If you like this Take Five clip be sure to check out the rest of the series and also check out our entire course catalog at Gymnasium. I hope to see you there! Take care.
