  <h2>Responsive Web Design Fundamentals</h2>
  <p>
    This course will feature a complete overhaul of our current responsive web design curriculum. You'll first learn how to think abstractly about the design decisions necessary to make content look great across multiple devices, then you'll move onto hands-on coding exercises that range from responsive typography and images to topics such as CSS layout with Flexbox and improving page performance.
